# BLUI - Blender Unreal Interface

![BLUI Splash](https://github.com/SpectralVectors/BLUI/blob/main/splash.png)

## How to Install

Download __BLUI.zip__ from the Releases section on the right.

Open __Blender__, and click on the __Blender__ logo in the top left corner.

Select __Install Application Template__.

Navigate to your __Downloads__ and select __BLUI.zip__, the click __Install...__.

To use the template, go to __File > New > BLUI__.

## NOTE

BLUI runs a startup script that will check for a number of community addons, and, if they're not found, download, install and activate them.

The total size is ~40mb, so, depending on the speed of your internet connection, Blender may appear to be frozen for a few minutes!

Please be patient, and, when the addons are all installed, the BLUI splashscreen will appear!

This will only happen if you don't already have the addons installed, and, once they are installed, startup is quick.

The full list of Community Addons is below:

- Jim Kroovy's Mr Mannequin's Tools
- BleuRaven's Blender for Unreal Engine
- Salai Vedha Viradan's Modifier Stack Manager
- SavMartin's TexTools
- and my own RightMouseNavigation, CommentBox
