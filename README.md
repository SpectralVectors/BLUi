# BLUI - Blender Unreal Interface

Bringing Unreal UX to Blender

## How to Install

Download __BLUI.zip__ from the Releases section on the right.

Open __Blender__, and click on the __Blender__ logo in the top left corner.

Select __Install Application Template__.

Navigate to your __Downloads__ and select __BLUI.zip__, the click __Install...__.

To use the template, go to __File > New > BLUI__.

## NOTE

BLUI depends on a handful of community addons to work properly:

- Jim Kroovy's Mr Mannequin's Tools
- BleuRaven's Blender for Unreal Engine
- Salai Vedha Viradan's Modifier Stack Manager
- SavMartin's TexTools
- and my own RightMouseNavigation, CommentBox, and maybe soon Transmat, too!

If you're not sure if you have all the right addons, you can run the setup script in the Scripting tab. 

It will automatically download, install and activate all the required addons (listed above).

If you already have the addons, the script shouldn't affect them, as the Overwrite setting is False.

You can add or remove any addon you like from the script before running it.
